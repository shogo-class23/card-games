I have applied the changes to `index.html` as you outlined.

Here's a summary of the modifications:

1.  **Re-added `extractMonsterParts` function:**
    *   This helper function is now available again and is responsible for parsing the `monsterName` string to extract `sizeName`, `powerName`, and `raceName`.

2.  **Updated `Card` constructor:**
    *   The `Card` constructor now stores `sizeName`, `powerName`, and `raceName` as direct properties (`this.sizeName`, `this.powerName`, `this.raceName`) on the `Card` object, making them accessible for rendering.

3.  **Revised `createCardEl` function:**
    *   The card rendering logic has been completely updated to follow the new structure you provided:
        *   The `div`'s class name is now set to `card ${card.suit}`.
        *   **`if (card.isFaceDown)`:** Remains the same for face-down cards.
        *   **`else if (card.isSupport)`:** Now handles all support cards, displaying their `rank` and `suit` in a left-aligned, bold format.
        *   **`else if (card.sizeName && card.powerName && card.raceName)`:** This block now handles "3つ型モンスター" (triple-type monsters). **The display of the name has been corrected to show `sizeName`, `powerName`, and `raceName` combined in a single, centrally located element with a `top:15px` positioning to ensure it's higher up.** It also displays `hp`, `attachedPower`, `requiredPower`, and `value` with the specified styling.
        *   **`else` (for "普通のトランプ" / normal trump cards)**: This block provides a default layout for all other cards, displaying `hp`, `rank`, `suit`, and power/ATK with left alignment.

These changes should correctly implement the new rendering styles for your cards.
